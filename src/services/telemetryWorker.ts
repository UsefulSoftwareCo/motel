/**
 * Worker-thread entry point for OTLP ingest.
 *
 * Spawned by the main process via `new Worker(new URL("./telemetryWorker.ts", import.meta.url))`.
 * This file runs inside a Bun Worker, so anything it imports is
 * evaluated in a FRESH module graph on the worker side. In particular
 * `TelemetryStoreWorkerLive` opens its own SQLite connection here — the main
 * thread's store connection is unrelated. SQLite's WAL journal mode
 * lets writer and query-worker connections coexist against the same
 * `.sqlite` file without blocking the HTTP event loop.
 *
 * The worker exposes only `ingestTraces` / `ingestLogs` (see ingestRpc.ts)
 * and owns writer maintenance. Read queries run in telemetryQueryWorker.ts;
 * neither path can block the HTTP event loop.
